This is a classic Pong game implementation.The only thing that this has different is that at the start both players have to
confirm that they are ready to start the game and after they are ready a countdown from 3 will start until 0 when the game starts.
At the end when a player reaches the score of 9 first, the game can be restarted by pressing 'r' which will redirect the screen back to
the screen where the players need to confirm that they are ready to start the game.


This game can be ran by running the PongGame class main method just like the SnakeGame and TetrisGame.
This game was built from the boilerplate of the snake game.
